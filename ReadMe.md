# Infinite Scrolling Application (practice constant fetching)

## Project Overview
This little application is going to be combined with my AudioPlayer in order to make a little feature blog that plays music. However, in the mean time this is meant to showcase making "infinite" API calls and scrolling continously. 

Infinite Effort leverages the jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API. Basics of the API is it allows virtually ulimited calls to get randomly generated, organized JSON data that can be used to build previews and test features. Perfect for this application. Look on the above website for documentation. 

### Features

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in VSCode. Itâ€™s a straightforward and enjoyable way to serve your project.

- **Live Server Extension**: [ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Instructions

1. **Install Live Server**: If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, you can do so from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your VSCode.
3. **Start the Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - Alternatively, click on the **Go Live** button in the bottom right corner of VSCode.
4. **Access the Application**: Your browser should automatically open with a local server running on port `5500`.

If you prefer using another local server like MAMP, feel free to do so.
